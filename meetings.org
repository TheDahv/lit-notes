** Brainstorming

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
20 years from now, what would be the newspaper headline about the impact of
Latinos in tech?
#+END_QUOTE

- LiT expands nation wide to promote technical/digital sovereignty among
  latino youth to foster local community solutions
- Latinos in Tech partners with Latino Tech owners to create additional
  social solutions to solve the world problems
- Look at them now: the emerging generation of Latinos in Tech mentor
  program kids
- Homes away from home: Latinos in tech creating communities to land in as
  latin students travel away from home to begin their education and careers
- Latinos in Tech raises funds and becomes a huge national success story
- Notion of a nation-wide latin in tech fraternity
- Raw ideas
      - "Seeing community-focused social impact"
      - more stories about founders raisinng funds or starting businesses,
        creating jobs and value in their communities because how they're being
        invested in now

** What do we have to do to get to those headlines?

- fundraising
- outreach and awareness
- event programming, organizing, and community building
- research
      - what don't we know? do we have a list? how do we find out?
      - how do we turn information into action?
      - who is our target audience? what is valuable to them?

** TODO Action Items [0/1]
- [ ] Draft research plan for the following areas
      - [ ]  Who are our audiences? And what do they care about?
      - [ ] Researching other networks?
      - [ ] Fundraising
      - [ ] Partnership and outreach
      - [ ] Interest and outreach
      - [ ] Advocacy

** Questions

- Expected commitment
      - 2-2.5 hour meeting length seems to work well
      - Distinguish between strategic "thinking" time in-person
      - Action or "do" time can happen ad-hoc and asynchronously
- Capacity for remote involvement
      - This will be necessary for members in the North and South sound area
- Cadence, time per month
      - Less regular than monthly is probably too infrequent
      - Monthly or biweekly is good to start
      - Tuesdays seem to work best for every one

- Organizing material and notes
      - Google Drive will probably work since LCF already has it and we all
        seem to have Google accounts or compatible services
      - Google Hangouts should cover remote conferencing

** Next Meeting

Scheduled for 17 September at 6:30
